      <h2 id="token-logic">The FABRICBOT Token</h2>

      <h3>Token Logic</h3>

      <p>
        The FABRICBOT token is an integral part of the platform's long-term strategy. From the beginning, the token is designed as a utility mechanism embedded directly into the payment ecosystem, not as a standalone speculative asset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our position is clear and transparent: the token exists to support internal platform processes, enable sustainable ecosystem growth, and build long-term relationships between participants.
      </p>

      <p>
        We deliberately follow a utility-token approach because we consider it the most resilient, secure, and aligned with real product needs and the evolving regulatory landscape.
      </p>

      <h3>Why the Token Matters in FABRICBOT</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is not just a payment tool — it is a growing ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within this ecosystem, the token acts as a connecting layer between users, payment logic, and partner-driven scenarios. Through the token, FABRICBOT is able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>record user participation in the ecosystem;</li>
        <li>define statuses and access levels;</li>
        <li>link payment infrastructure with ecosystem benefits;</li>
        <li>create long-term incentives for partners and active contributors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The token does not exist independently of the product — it is designed as part of the overall FABRICBOT architecture.
      </p>

      <h2 id="donation-model">Donation Model and Current Implementation</h2>

      <p>
        At the current stage, FABRICBOT already includes an active donation-based participation model, which is used as a way to support ecosystem development and enable early participation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users may voluntarily make a donation on the TON blockchain and receive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>an ecosystem participation status;</li>
        <li>access to additional features within FABRICBOT;</li>
        <li>privileges and benefits provided by platform partners.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is important to emphasize that this donation model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>is not an investment;</li>
        <li>does not include any promises of financial returns;</li>
        <li>serves solely as a form of participation and support for the product.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This logic is already integrated into the FABRICBOT payment system and directly connected to internal user statuses.
      </p>

      <h2 id="statuses-perks">Statuses, Perks, and Ecosystem Benefits</h2>

      <p>
        The FABRICBOT token serves as the foundation of a status-based model within the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>Depending on their status, users may receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reduced or optimized platform fees;</li>
        <li>access to partner offers and discounts;</li>
        <li>priority conditions for using platform services;</li>
        <li>additional capabilities within the payment system.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT partners may provide their own perks and benefits to ecosystem participants, and the platform automatically applies the appropriate conditions during payment execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, token-based statuses and donation participation become part of a single, unified payment logic, rather than an external or manual add-on.
      </p>

      <h2 id="token-integration">Token Integration with Payment Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        One of the core principles of FABRICBOT is automation.
      </p>

      <p>
        User status and participation in the donation model are recognized by the system automatically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>during payment execution;</li>
        <li>when applying fees;</li>
        <li>when granting access to partner offers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Users do not need to manually confirm or prove their status — all relevant information is embedded into the FABRICBOT payment architecture and applied on-chain.
      </p>

      <h2 id="long-term-approach">Long-Term Token Development Approach</h2>

      <p>
        We view the FABRICBOT token as a long-term component of the ecosystem and follow a phased, responsible approach to its development.
      </p>

      <p>Our priorities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>security and transparency;</li>
        <li>compliance with regulatory requirements;</li>
        <li>practical value for users;</li>
        <li>gradual expansion of utility functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All updates and changes related to token logic and functionality will be communicated openly through official FABRICBOT channels: <a href="https://t.me/@fabricbotai">https://t.me/@fabricbotai</a>
