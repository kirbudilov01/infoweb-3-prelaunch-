      <p>
        FABRICBOT is built by a team of practitioners who work daily with Telegram, Web3, and AI-driven products and actively use the platform within their own services. We are not building abstract infrastructure — FABRICBOT is developed as a practical payment solution, validated through real-world use cases.
      </p>
