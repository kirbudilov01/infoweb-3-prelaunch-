      <h2 id="main-features">1.1 Main Features of Product</h2>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is a Web3 payment platform built for the Telegram ecosystem and the TON blockchain. We are developing an infrastructure that enables businesses and creators to accept payments, build partner and referral sales models, and scale globally through an open API — without custody of funds and without centralized control.
      </p>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is designed as a universal payment layer for Telegram-first products, digital services, and Web3 projects. It combines a user-facing interface, on-chain execution, and flexible integration tools into a single system that can be used both inside Telegram and across external websites and services.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the ground up, FABRICBOT is built as a non-custodial solution. This means the platform does not store user funds, does not have access to wallets, and cannot interfere with financial operations. All transactions are executed directly through smart contracts on the TON blockchain and are publicly verifiable on-chain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core idea behind FABRICBOT is to remove unnecessary intermediaries from the process of accepting and distributing payments — while preserving simplicity for end users and making partner-based sales models accessible even to small and independent sellers.
      </p>

      <p>We see several fundamental challenges in the current market:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>launching payment infrastructure remains complex for creators and small teams;</li>
        <li>partner and referral models often rely on manual tracking and trust in centralized platforms;</li>
        <li>traditional payment providers introduce additional risks, limitations, and points of control.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT addresses these challenges through transparent on-chain logic and automated rule execution. Payment terms and revenue distribution rules are defined upfront, and their execution is enforced by smart contracts — not by manual operations or discretionary platform decisions. For users, this means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>fast and simple launch of payment scenarios;</li>
        <li>predictable and transparent rules;</li>
        <li>no need to trust the platform as a custodian of funds.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In FABRICBOT, Web3 is not used as an ideology or a marketing label. It is used as a technological foundation that makes financial processes transparent, verifiable, and resistant to centralized control.
      </p>

      <h2 id="components">1.2 Components of Ecosystem</h2>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT consists of several core components that together form a unified payment ecosystem. Each component is designed to work seamlessly with the others, providing transparency, automation, and scalability.
      </p>

      <h3>Telegram Mini App</h3>

      <p>
        The Telegram Mini App is the primary interface for interacting with FABRICBOT. It serves as the main entry point for users, creators, and partners within the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>Through the Mini App, users can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>create digital products and payment offers;</li>
        <li>set pricing and partner or referral reward conditions;</li>
        <li>accept payments;</li>
        <li>track sales, referrals, and performance statistics;</li>
        <li>manage their status within the FABRICBOT ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By using Telegram as the core interface, FABRICBOT significantly lowers the barrier to entry. Users do not need to install additional applications or learn complex interfaces — all interactions take place in a familiar environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Mini App Expansion Vision</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is designed from the outset with extensibility in mind. The Mini App architecture allows for future expansion and deeper functionality.
      </p>

      <p>Planned directions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>integration of a no-code app and store builder, enabling rapid creation of payment interfaces, storefronts, and services without custom development;</li>
        <li>use of automated and AI-driven tools to generate stores and payment scenarios;</li>
        <li>expansion of P2P payment logic, where one user can pay on behalf of another user or directly for a specific action, product, or service — without transferring funds between personal accounts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This approach enables alternative payment scenarios based not on money transfers between users, but on the fact of payment execution.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Telegram Is the Foundation of FABRICBOT</h3>

      <p>Using Telegram as the core environment allows FABRICBOT to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>significantly reduce onboarding friction;</li>
        <li>eliminate the need for standalone applications;</li>
        <li>provide instant access to payment functionality;</li>
        <li>scale globally within the Telegram ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All FABRICBOT interactions occur within a familiar interface, making the payment ecosystem accessible both to Web3-native users and to users without technical or blockchain experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Smart Contract on the TON Blockchain</h3>

      <p>
        The smart contract on the TON blockchain is the technical core of FABRICBOT. It defines the system's rules and is responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>accepting payments;</li>
        <li>distributing funds among participants;</li>
        <li>executing partner and referral conditions;</li>
        <li>recording transactions and user statuses on-chain.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The smart contract operates according to predefined logic and cannot be modified manually. This ensures predictable behavior and full transparency across the entire system.
      </p>

      <p>FABRICBOT has no technical ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>freeze user funds;</li>
        <li>redirect payments;</li>
        <li>alter distribution rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Flow</h3>

      <p>The payment flow in FABRICBOT is designed to be simple and transparent.</p>

      <p>A typical payment process follows these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A user initiates a payment via the Telegram Mini App or through an external website integration.</li>
        <li>The transaction is submitted to the smart contract.</li>
        <li>Funds are distributed according to predefined rules.</li>
        <li>The result is permanently recorded on the blockchain.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT does not act as an intermediary between the payer and the recipient and does not hold user funds at any point.
      </p>

      <h3>Referral and Partner Flow</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT supports referral and partner-based growth models, enabling collaborative and scalable distribution.
      </p>

      <p>Within the system, users can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>define single-level referral rewards;</li>
        <li>automatically distribute partner payouts;</li>
        <li>track the performance of referral-driven traffic.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This creates the foundation for an ecosystem where participants can exchange leads and grow their products together — without manual accounting or reliance on external services.
      </p>

      <h3>Conceptual Payment Flow</h3>

      <p>At a conceptual level, the FABRICBOT payment flow works as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A creator or seller publishes a payment offer.</li>
        <li>A customer arrives directly or via a partner.</li>
        <li>Payment is initiated through FABRICBOT.</li>
        <li>The smart contract executes the transaction.</li>
        <li>Funds are distributed among participants.</li>
        <li>The result is recorded on-chain.</li>
        <li>Each step is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="use-cases">1.3 Use Cases and Target Audience</h2>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is designed from the ground up as a universal payment layer, making it suitable for a wide range of users and business models. Below are the core use cases where the platform delivers the most value.
      </p>

      <h3>Creators and Experts</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is well suited for content creators, experts, course authors, and service providers who need a fast and transparent way to accept payments from their audience. With FABRICBOT, creators can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>accept payments for digital products, subscriptions, and services;</li>
        <li>launch payment pages and storefronts directly inside Telegram;</li>
        <li>onboard partners and build referral-based sales models;</li>
        <li>track sales performance and audience acquisition efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Telegram-first approach enables creators to work directly with their audience, without complex payment integrations and without reliance on centralized payment providers.
      </p>

      <h3>SaaS and Digital Products</h3>

      <p>
        For SaaS projects and digital services, FABRICBOT acts as a payment infrastructure layer that can be embedded into an existing product. FABRICBOT enables SaaS teams to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>integrate payment acceptance via an open API;</li>
        <li>use Telegram as an additional sales and onboarding channel;</li>
        <li>implement partner-driven growth models;</li>
        <li>scale payment scenarios without redesigning core business logic.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thanks to on-chain execution and transparent fund distribution rules, the platform reduces operational risk and simplifies payment management.
      </p>

      <h3>Communities and Marketplaces</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is a strong fit for communities, community-driven platforms, and marketplaces where economic interaction between participants is a core element. The system allows communities to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>create shared catalogs of offers and services;</li>
        <li>build models for exchanging leads and value;</li>
        <li>automatically track and distribute rewards;</li>
        <li>support participation-based and contribution-driven economics.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This approach is especially effective for communities that want to grow through internal connections rather than centralized advertising channels.
      </p>

      <h3>Web3 and Telegram-First Projects</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is designed for projects that are built natively within the Telegram and Web3 ecosystem. For these projects, the platform provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ready-to-use payment infrastructure on the TON blockchain;</li>
        <li>seamless integration with Telegram Mini Apps;</li>
        <li>transparent on-chain execution;</li>
        <li>the ability to quickly launch and iterate on new payment scenarios.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT allows Web3 projects to focus on product development and community growth, without allocating resources to building and maintaining their own payment systems.
      </p>

      <h2 id="security">1.4 Security and On-Chain Logic</h2>

      <p>
        At FABRICBOT, security is not based on promises or trust in the platform. It is built into the system architecture and enforced by rules encoded directly on the blockchain. From the outset, FABRICBOT is designed to minimize risk and eliminate the need to transfer control over funds to any third party.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-Custodial Model</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT operates under a non-custodial model. This means the platform does not store user funds and does not act as a custodial service provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        All payments are executed directly through smart contracts on the TON blockchain. FABRICBOT does not accumulate funds on its own accounts and does not manage user balances off-chain. Users always remain the sole owners of their funds, while the platform functions purely as a technical layer that enforces predefined logic.
      </p>

      <h3>Transaction Transparency</h3>

      <p>
        All transactions in FABRICBOT are executed on-chain and recorded on the TON blockchain, ensuring full transparency of payment operations.
      </p>

      <p>Any participant in the system can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>verify that a payment has occurred;</li>
        <li>confirm the correctness of fund distribution;</li>
        <li>review the complete transaction history.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Transparency is therefore guaranteed at the infrastructure level, not through internal reports or reliance on platform trust.
      </p>

      <h3>No Access to User Funds</h3>

      <p>FABRICBOT has no technical ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>withdraw user funds;</li>
        <li>freeze payments;</li>
        <li>redirect transactions;</li>
        <li>modify the conditions of completed operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The platform does not hold users' private keys and does not control their wallets. All actions are initiated by users and executed strictly according to smart contract logic.
      </p>

      <h3>The Role of the Smart Contract</h3>

      <p>
        The smart contract on the TON blockchain is the central element of FABRICBOT's payment logic. It defines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>payment acceptance rules;</li>
        <li>fund distribution conditions;</li>
        <li>partner and referral mechanisms;</li>
        <li>recording of transactions, statuses, and system events.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The smart contract acts as a set of immutable rules that apply equally to all participants and cannot be altered manually or unilaterally.
      </p>

      <h3>Platform Responsibility Boundaries</h3>

      <p>FABRICBOT provides technological infrastructure but is not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a traditional payment operator;</li>
        <li>a custodian of funds;</li>
        <li>a guarantor of obligations between users.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The platform's responsibility is limited to the correct operation of smart contracts and user interaction interfaces. All financial transactions occur directly between participants, under predefined and transparent rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach reduces operational and regulatory risk and makes the system resilient to centralized failures.
      </p>

      <h2 id="open-api">1.5 Open API and System Scaling</h2>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT is designed not only as a user-facing application, but also as a payment infrastructure that can be embedded into third-party products, websites, and services. For this purpose, the platform includes an open API that is a core part of the product architecture.
      </p>

      <h3>Open API as a Core Product Component</h3>

      <p>
        The Open API in FABRICBOT is a foundational architectural element, not an auxiliary add-on. Through the API, developers and businesses can integrate FABRICBOT's payment logic directly into their own products while retaining all the benefits of on-chain execution and the non-custodial model.
      </p>

      <p>
        The API enables direct interaction with payment scenarios without requiring the Telegram Mini App as the sole interface. This makes the system flexible and applicable to a wide range of use cases.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Integration Scenarios</h3>

      <p>The FABRICBOT Open API supports multiple integration scenarios, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>accepting payments on external websites and services;</li>
        <li>integrating with existing products and platforms;</li>
        <li>handling payment events and transaction statuses;</li>
        <li>supporting partner and referral-based scenarios.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This approach allows FABRICBOT to function as a payment layer without requiring changes to the core architecture of the integrating product.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment Module for Websites</h3>

      <p>
        FABRICBOT provides a payment module that can be embedded into external websites and services. This enables businesses to accept payments on the TON blockchain through a familiar web interface, while all financial logic continues to execute on-chain.
      </p>

      <p>The payment module:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>simplifies integration;</li>
        <li>lowers the technical barrier to entry;</li>
        <li>allows teams to launch payment scenarios quickly without deep product refactoring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scaling Through Partners</h3>

      <p>
        Scaling FABRICBOT is driven not only by user growth, but also by a partner-based expansion model. The system allows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>onboarding partners and external teams;</li>
        <li>building joint payment scenarios;</li>
        <li>scaling distribution through offers and partner programs;</li>
        <li>distributing load and ecosystem growth across participants.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By combining an open API with a partner-driven approach, FABRICBOT can scale both technically and economically without creating centralized points of control.
      </p>
